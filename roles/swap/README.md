## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.swap
      swap_files:
        - path: /my.swap
          size: 1024
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.sysctl
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://buluma.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for swap

# Set the swappiness, 60 is default for Fedora 31.
swap_swappiness: 60

# A list of swap files to add. The list must container **path** (an absolute path to a file) and **size** (an integer in megabytes).
# swap_files:
#   - path: /my.swap
#     size: 1024
```
