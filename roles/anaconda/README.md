## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.anaconda
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies
    - role: buluma.epel
    - role: buluma.buildtools
    - role: buluma.python_pip
```


## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for anaconda

anaconda_python_version: 3

# The version of anaconda to install.
# See https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
