# You can pass key value pair to this role, which will place the facts in
# `custom.fact`. For example this dictionary:

# facts:
#   - key: datacenter
#     value: Amsterdam
#   - key: availability_zone
#     value: west
#
# Would make these facts available:
#
#         "ansible_local": {
#             "custom": {
#                 "availability_zone": "west",
#                 "datacenter": "Amsterdam"
#             }
#         },
