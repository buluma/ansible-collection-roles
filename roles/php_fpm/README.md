## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.php_fpm
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.epel
    - role: buluma.buildtools
    - role: buluma.python_pip
    - role: buluma.openssl
      openssl_items:
        - name: apache-httpd
          common_name: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
    - role: buluma.httpd
```


## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for php_fpm

# The `php_fpm_listen` parameter can be an address:port combination or a path
# if you want to use a socket. For example: "127.0.0.1:9000"

php_fpm_listen: "{{ php_fpm_pid_directory }}/www.sock"

# When using a socket in `php_fpm_listen`, you can set the user and group.
# Sane defaults are set in `vars/main.yml`
php_fpm_listen_owner: "{{ php_fpm_owner }}"
php_fpm_listen_group: "{{ php_fpm_group }}"
php_fpm_listen_mode: "0666"

php_fpm_pm: dynamic
php_fpm_pm_max_children: 5
php_fpm_pm_start_servers: 2
php_fpm_pm_min_spare_servers: 1
php_fpm_pm_max_spare_servers: 3
```
