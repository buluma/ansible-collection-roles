# defaults file for restore

# What directory are the objects to be restored saved?
restore_directory: backups

# The directory of objects which need to be placed on the managed node
# temporarily.
restore_remote_directory: /tmp

# Credentials to login to the mysql database, only require when restoring mysql
# objects.
# restore_mysql_username: "my_user"
# restore_mysql_password: "my_pass"

# A list of objects to restore.
# Each list item should have:
# - name to find the object locally.
#   type, either directory or mysql.
#   destination, a directory where to unpack the object.
#
# Nota bene; the [backup role](http://galaxy.ansible.com/buluma/backup) can be used to create restorable objects. The objects created with this role include the parent directory, so the destination mentioned here ~misses~ the last part of the directory

restore_objects:
  - name: varspool
    type: directory
    destination: /var
#  - name: drupal
#    type: mysql
#    destination: drupal
