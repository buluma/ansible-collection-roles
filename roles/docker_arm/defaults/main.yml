# Different ARM platforms may have different versions of Docker available. By
# default, this role will install the latest version available. You can override
# this behavior by setting a specific version, like:
#
# docker_version: 5:20.10.10~3-0~debian-buster (for arm64)
#
# Check available versions: `apt-cache madison docker-ce`
docker_version: "latest"

# Whether to install recommended packages alongside docker-ce.
docker_install_recommends: false

# Whether to install Docker Compose via Pip.
docker_install_compose: true

# A list of users who will be added to the docker group.
docker_users: []

# The executable to use for Pip.
