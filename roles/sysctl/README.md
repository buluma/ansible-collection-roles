## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.sysctl
      sysctl_items:
        - name: net.ipv4.ip_forward
          value: 1
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
```


## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for sysctl

# Verify token value with the sysctl command and set with -w if necessary
sysctl_set: yes

# if yes, performs a /sbin/sysctl -p if the sysctl_file is updated.
# If no, does not reload sysctl even if the sysctl_file is updated
sysctl_reload: yes
```
