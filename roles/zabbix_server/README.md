## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.zabbix_server
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.selinux
    - role: buluma.container_docs
    - role: buluma.mysql
      mysql_databases:
        - name: zabbix
          encoding: utf8
          collation: utf8_bin
      mysql_users:
        - name: zabbix
          password: zabbix
          priv: "zabbix.*:ALL"
    - role: buluma.ca_certificates
    - role: buluma.zabbix_repository
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies
```
