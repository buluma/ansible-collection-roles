## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.cargo
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.buildtools
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://buluma.co.ke/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for cargo

# The destination where cargo should be installed.
cargo_prefix: /usr/local

# Where to drop the downloaded installer.
cargo_tmp: /root
```
