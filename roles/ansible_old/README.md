## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.ansible
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.epel
    - role: buluma.buildtools
    - role: buluma.python_pip
```


## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for ansible

ansible_configuration:
  - option: roles_path
    value: roles
  - option: retry_files_enabled
    value: "no"
  - option: inventory
    value: inventory
  - option: stdout_callback
    value: yaml
