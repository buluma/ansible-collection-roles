## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.elastic_repo
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies
```


## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for elastic_repo

# The software is free to use under the Elastic license.
# An alternative package which contains only features that are available
# under the Apache 2.0 license is also available.

# Elastic has two versions of the packages:
# - "elastic" using the "Elastic" license.
# - "oss" using the Apache 2.0 license.
