## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.y
      y_import_from: /data/in
      y_export_to: files/out
      y_presets:
        - name: monochrome
```

The machine needs to be prepared in CI this is done using `molecule/resources/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.epel

  tasks:
    - name: create directories in container
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: "{{ item }}"
        state: directory
        mode: "0644"
      with_items:
        - /data
        - /data/in
        - /data/out

    - name: copy samples files to /data/in
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: in/
        dest: /data/in
        mode: "0644"
```
